1. Introduction

2. Methods

- bayesian linear regression 
  - intuitive approach to bayesian linear models: regularization
    - why regularization? 
    - bayesian linear regression with a gaussian prior is equal to ridge regularization
    - bayesian linear regression with laplace prior is equal to lasso regularization
    
  - inference in bayesian LMs
    - posterior predictive distribution in closed form
    
  - bayesian linear regression with other priors -> further use cases of bayesian linear models
  
  - choice of priors, conjugate priors?
    - uninformative priors for $\beta$ and $\sigma^2$ or just for $\sigma^2$
    - suitable informative priors for linear bayesian models
      - variable selection: spike and slab vs. laplace priors (vs. bayesian ridge)
      - 
  
  - estimation: Laplace Approximation and MCMC
  
- bayesian generalised linear regression
  - logistic regression
  - probit
  - general?
- hierarchical GLMs
  - GLMMs

3. Simulation Study


4. Conclusion + Outlook
