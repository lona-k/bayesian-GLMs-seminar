\subsection{Bayesian Generalized Regression}\label{sec:logit-glm}



\subsection{Bayesian Logistic Regression} \label{sec:logit-logit}

\subsubsection*{Model definition}

\subsubsection*{Prior choice}


- note similarities with naive bayesian classification!

\textbf{Regularization priors}


\subsection{Bayesian inference with numerical approximation and simulation} \label{sec:logit-inf}

- For e.g these conjugate priors, inference can be done in closed form as explained in section, 
- but for most priors in GLMs this is not possible
- we will introduce 2 algorithms for numerical inference

\subsubsection*{MCMC and HM}


\subsubsection*{Laplace Approximation}
